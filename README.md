# Oral-Cancer-Detection-from-Mouth-Images
Oral Cancer is life-threatening, needing early detection for survival. This project applies RNNs on mouth images, demographic data and medical records to track lesions and temporal patterns. Using pre-processing, clinical notes and heterogeneous data, the model improves accuracy, sensitivity and specificity over standard methods => mouth condition.
