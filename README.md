# Oral-Cancer-Detection-from-Mouth-Images

Over time, Oral cancer has been a prevalent and life-threatening disease which needs early attention and proper diagnosis for efficient treatment and patient’s survival. The project aims to deep dive into the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect oral cancer through mouth images. The RNNs that are known to handle tasks that are sequentially arranged are implemented here to detect and highlight the abnormal lesions in oral cavity images. Considering the high mortality rate associated with detection of oral cancer at a latestage, early identification is important in improving survival prospects and treatment efficacy. 

The study primarily focuses on leveraging RNNs to facilitate early treatment and diagnosis by analyzing both mouth images and patient’s medical records. As we know, RNN is an efficient deep learning model particularly designed to analyze and interpret sequential information, thus applied to track and understand time-based patterns within patient’s records. The dataset used in this work includes clinical mouth images, demographic details and patients’ medical histories, all of them are used properly to train and assess the network. The model has been designed in such a way that it is able to detect early indicators of oral cancer by learning from sequential variations that emerge over time. 

Important elements of the applied methodology include image preprocessing to enrich diagnostic details, merging of textual clinical notes that provides a holistic view of the patient’s condition and the use of RNNs to interpret temporal trends in oral health deterioration. The system is aimed to recognize early, subtle anomalies that might not yet be present as obvious symptoms, thereby allowing for quicker intervention. 

Model performance is quantified in terms of accuracy, sensitivity & specificity and compared with standard diagnostic methods. Additional examination incorporates the system's flexibility in dealing with various patient data and its stability in processing heterogeneous sources. In general, the study exhibits the capabilities of RNNs to increase the early diagnosis of oral cancer and presents a promising tool to improve diagnostic accuracy and diminish the public health burden of the disease.
